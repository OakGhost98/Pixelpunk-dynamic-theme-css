# My Project

This is a project that I created that suits and works well with the [PixelPunk Dynamic theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-punk-dynamic-theme/)
that works well with my css.
Please provide any valuable information that could help me improve on my css.
On about:config set the siderbar.revamp to true and siderbar.verticalTabs to true.
