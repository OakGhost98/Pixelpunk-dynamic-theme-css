# My Project
![Dynamictheme](images/Dynamictheme.png)

This is a project that I created that suits and works well with the [PixelPunk Dynamic theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-punk-dynamic-theme/).
Please provide any valuable information that could help me improve on my css.
I'll try to keep updating the repo, I'm using librewolf so the css worked well with me
